The cron scripts (represented in the crontab file) are run through the
"scriptrunner" wrapper script. See the documentation in that file for more
information about its usage and intent.

You will also need to install the "lockfile" and "psutil" packages for
scriptrunner to function. Please do so using:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
