  <h2>Partner Onboarding Checklist</h2>
  <p><strong>Purpose of this call:</strong> This is an introduction to the 10gen engineering/support team.  We value our Partners as an extension of the 10gen technical team; as such we're here to help and advise as the Partner builds expertise in MongoDB.  This call is intended to provide the basis for an ongoing engineer-to-engineer relationship, explain the support process, and record an overview of the partner's background/skills/expertise.</p>
